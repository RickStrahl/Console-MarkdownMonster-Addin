# Console Addin for Markdown Monster

This is a simple sample addin that creates a Console Powershell window and 'attaches' to the bottom of your Markdown Monster window instance. As you move the window the terminal goes along for the ride.

This is just an initial quickie. 

Things to do:

* Add configuration for
    * Terminal Command Line
    * Initial Arguments
    * Initial Height
